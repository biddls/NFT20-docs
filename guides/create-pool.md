# Create a NFT20 pool for your NFT

Creating a pool for your NFT project is really simple and will help your community achieve liquidity and swaps for all your NFTs in a simple manner.

1. Go to [https://nft20.io/assets](https://nft20.io/assets).
1. Click on "ADD ASSET".
1. Paste in the NFT address, we support the ERC1155 and ERC721 standards.
1. Pay the TX fees.

Done! You can now go to your asset page within NFT20 and tokenize any NFTs you or your community.

> Transaction fees may seem high and similar to a Uniswap pool creation as it will create a new contract and ERC20 token but that's expected.

Here is a video demonstrating the process:
